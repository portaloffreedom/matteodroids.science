Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at [Computational Intelligence Group](https://www.cs.vu.nl/ci/) with a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The focus of my research is looking into environmental and social influences over robotic evolution and exploring the ethical aspects of it.

During my Ph.D. research, I will be closely collaborating with the researchers at the universities in Bristol, Edinburgh (Napier), and York to build an [Autonomous Robotics Evolution (ARE)](https://www.york.ac.uk/robot-lab/are/) system.
