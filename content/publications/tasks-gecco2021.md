A well-established fact in biology is that the environmental conditions have a paramount impact on the evolved life forms. In this paper we investigate this in an evolutionary robot system where morphologies and controllers evolve together. We evolve robots for two tasks independently and simultaneously and compare the outcomes. The results show that the robots evolved for multiple tasks simultaneously developed new morphologies that were not present in the robots evolved for single tasks independently.
