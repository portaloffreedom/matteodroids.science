Ported the Wicked Engine to Linux. Collaborator and linux port responsable since then.

Wicked Engine is an open-source C++ engine focusing on modern rendering techniques and performance. Use this as a framework for your graphics projects, or learning. Some programming skills are required for the best experience, but some simple tools like an Editor are also included. It is free to be used for anything good.
